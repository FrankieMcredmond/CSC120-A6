- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance saved me a significant amount of time when creating the house, library, and cafe class because I could reuse methods I had already written out. Although I could see issues arising in more complicated programs. I wouldn't be able to keep track of which methods are carried through if I have two parent classes, or just a large number of java docs. But overall, organizationally, I think inheritance just makes sense to my brain. 

As for the class in general, I think while on paper I'm doing pretty well in the class, I'm worried about things snowballing towards the end of the semester. I need to go back and redo A4, because I only finished like half of it when I turned it in. But now I have to find time to revisit it, which is hard when I'm getting more coding assignments to do, and midterms in other classes. To someone taking this class in the future, I would say that the rolling deadlines are nice but also deceiving. Since if you're like me, you will just keep putting off an assignment if you don't get a good grade the first time.
